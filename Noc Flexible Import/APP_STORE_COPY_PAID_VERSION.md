Subject: My New Pilot Logbook App - Would Love Feedback

Hey,

I'm an airline captain and built a pilot logbook app after getting tired 
of LogTen Pro's limitations and high price.

ProPilot is $79/year (vs LogTen's $99) and has features they don't:
- Import schedules from crew scheduling (HUGE time saver)
- GPS flight tracking
- Full Apple Watch app
- 5,000+ airports with weather
- Works completely offline

There's a free trial - would you mind checking it out and letting me 
know what you think? Any feedback would be awesome.

Thanks!

## **14. CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION FOR PAID APP**

### Key Psychology:
1. **Anchor to higher prices** (LogTen $99, ForeFlight $299)
2. **Show annual savings** ($40 saved vs monthly)
3. **Emphasize unique features** (schedule import)
4. **Free trial removes risk** (try before buy)
5. **Built by pilot = credibility**

### Pricing Display Order:
1. Show annual FIRST (best value)
2. Show savings prominently ("Save $40!")
3. Show competitor prices for comparison
4. Make annual the "recommended" option

---

## **BOTTOM LINE**

Your revised positioning:

**"ProPilot - Professional pilot features at a fair price"**
- $79/year (best value) or $9.99/month
- Less than LogTen Pro ($99)
- Way less than ForeFlight ($299)
- Only app with schedule import
- Built by an airline captain
- Free trial available

This is still a **strong value proposition** - you just need to emphasize the competitive pricing and unique features!
