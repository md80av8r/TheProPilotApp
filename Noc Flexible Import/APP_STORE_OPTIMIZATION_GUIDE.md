# ProPilot App Store Optimization (ASO) Recommendations

## 🎯 **CURRENT vs. OPTIMIZED**

---

## **1. PROMOTIONAL TEXT** (170 chars max)
*This appears at the top and can be edited without app review*

### ❌ Current (Too Technical):
```
Your cockpit companion. Calculates leg times, duty hours & block totals automatically. FAR 117 compliant. Integrated scanner. Built by a 121 captain who flies the line.
```
**Problems:**
- "Integrated scanner" - what does this mean to pilots?
- Too focused on features, not benefits
- Doesn't grab attention
- Misses key value proposition

### ✅ RECOMMENDED (170 chars):
```
FREE for all pilots! ✈️ Track flights, monitor duty times, import schedules & access 5,000+ airports with FBO info. Works offline. No ads, no subscription. Try it now!
```

**Why better:**
- Leads with "FREE" (removes barrier)
- Lists top benefits quickly
- "Works offline" = reliability
- "No ads, no subscription" = trustworthy
- Action call: "Try it now!"

---

## **2. DESCRIPTION** (4,000 chars max)

### ❌ Current (Too Generic & Bland):
```
FlightAware Base Flight Tracking Data
Airline Schedules, Gate Assignments and Gate Times

ProPilot is a professional digital logbook designed for professional pilots, built by an active airline pilot who flies MD-88s for USA Jet. The app assists the pilot making manual logbook entries and trip/flight tracking with an integrated system that handles flight logging, FAR compliance monitoring, and duty time tracking, all synced across iPhone and Apple Watch.
```

**Problems:**
- Starts with FlightAware (confusing - is this a FlightAware app?)
- "professional pilots" repeated - redundant
- No emotional hook
- Doesn't explain who it's for
- Buries the best features
- No clear call-to-action

## **13. APP STORE SEARCH OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

### How Apple's Algorithm Works:
1. **App Name** (30 chars) - Highest weight
2. **Subtitle** (30 chars) - High weight  
3. **Keywords** (100 chars) - Medium weight
4. **Description** - Low weight (but affects conversion!)
5. **Reviews/Ratings** - Affects ranking
6. **Downloads** - Velocity matters (more = higher rank)

### Your Strategy:
1. Keep "ProPilot" name (short, memorable)
2. Add subtitle: "Pilot Logbook & Schedule"
3. Use optimized keywords
4. Get reviews (ask users, ask colleagues)
5. Drive traffic from outside App Store

---

## **14. GETTING INITIAL REVIEWS**

### Ask These People:
1. ✈️ Your airline colleagues (10-20 pilots)
2. ✈️ Pilot friends at other airlines
3. ✈️ CFIs you know

5. ✈️ Post in pilot Facebook groups

Would you mind downloading it and leaving an honest review?

[Link to App Store]

```

### Incentivize Reviews (Carefully):
- Don't pay for reviews (against Apple rules)

- DO make it easy (direct App Store link)
- DO follow up with non-reviewers
